<h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>
    We designed this tool to be as flexible as possible. It is fully configurable, meaning that each execution receives
    a complete set of inputs (as described before), that fully describes which audio files to consider, which packet
    loss distribution to generate, which PLC algorithm to use, and which metrics to compute on the outputs. Each of
    these inputs includes the configurable settings of the related component. It is also fully modular, meaning that the
    execution pipeline is decoupled from the units performing the computations. There is an abstract base class for
    every kind of worker: <b><i>OriginalAudio</i></b>, <b><i>PacketLossSimulator</i></b>, <b><i>PLCAlgorithm</i></b>, and <b><i>OutputMetric</i></b>. Any implementation
    of such classes is a module so adding a new one is as easy as inheriting from the base class.
</p>
<h1>Modules</h1>
<p>
    There are four module types: <b><i>OriginalAudio</i></b>, <b><i>PacketLossSimulator</i></b>, <b><i>PLCAlgorithm</i></b>, and <b><i>OutputMetric</i></b>.
</p>
<h2>
    OriginalAudio
</h2>
<p>
    For this type, we built just one simple module that loads the audio content into memory and extracts metadata
    information (i.e. Sampling Frequency).
</p>
<h2>
    PacketLossSimulator
</h2>
<p>
    This family of modules represents all the available ways of generating packet loss sequences.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
        <h4>BinomialPLS:</h4> this is the simplest model for PLS as it is the implementation of
        a uniform distribution. Its only parameters are the Packet Error Ratio (PER) and the seed of the random
        function.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        <h4>GilbertElliotPLS:</h4> this is a more realistic model for PLS as in most cases there is no packet
        loss in the network. On the other hand, it may happen that when a packet is eventually lost, subsequent packets
        will be lost as well creating a bust of lost packets. The Gilbert-Elliot model (cite) models that using a
        two-state machine. These two states represent the situations where the channel is behaving correctly and when
        the packet loss burst happens respectively. There are four probabilities governing the transitions between the
        states. Each state has a probability of transitioning back to itself and a probability of transitioning to the
        other state. These four probabilities are configurable parameters and govern the behavior of the model.
