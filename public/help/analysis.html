<h1>Analysis of the execution’s results</h1>
<p>
This module was considered from the very beginning as the most important one, so a great part of the time spent in the
analysis and development of the PLC Testbench UI was dedicated to it.
In this case the focus was on providing an easy way to analyze the results from both qualitative and quantitative
perspectives.
</p>
<p>
Qualitative analysis is mainly represented by browsing and visually comparing the waveforms in the regions where packets
have been lost and by listening to the audio files generated from the PLC algorithms.
</p>
<p>
Quantitative analysis is mainly represented by the numerical comparison of the performance achieved by the PLC
algorithms according to a given metric like the Mean Squared Error, the Mean Absolute Error, the Spectral Energy, the
Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) with respect to the specified input parameters.
</p>
<p>
Another extremely important aspect was providing the capability to integrate and correlate as much as possible the
different types of information to get deeper insight into the behavior of the algorithms being tested.
</p>
The main requirements in this case were:
<ul>
    <li>
        clearly show the lost portions of the original file
    </li>
    <li>
        allow easy comparison of the waveforms ranging from very high level to sample level detail
    </li>
    <li>
        give the possibility to display every combination of waveforms in the comparison
    </li>
    <li>
        give the possibility to play any audio track, original or reconstructed setting the playhead at any position by
        simply clicking on the waveform
    </li>
    <li>
        support a very wide range of zoom levels including a sample level one
    </li>
    <li>
        display visually the metrics calculated on the reconstructed audio files
    </li>
    <li>
        display a spectrogram of the audiofile, be it the original or a reconstructed one
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The need to display multiple information at the same time made a dashboard interface more appropriate and appealing
    in this case. The dashboard was organized in 4 sections where the first one is focused on representing the waveforms
    of all the audio versions of an input file and providing navigation across the files and zoom functions. Lost
    samples region are displayed together with the waveform and when clicked the corresponding detailed data are loaded
    in the section below.
</p>
<p>
    The second section provides the ability to inspect the waveform at sample level in any region were some samples were
    lost. This is extremely useful to evaluate from a qualitative point of view the behaviour of the algorithm and to
    cross check the correctness of the algorithm’s implementation as visual representation makes any misbehaviour much
    more apparent.
</p>
<p>
    The third section is intended to display the metrics calculated on the reconstructed versions of the analyzed file
    and is made by two different charts, one containing the figures from metrics producing time series, the other
    representing the figures from metrics producing single values.
</p>
<p>
    Finally the fourth section displays the spectrogram of the current audio file, representing the distribution of the
    frequencies composing it and their relative and absolute intensity in the form of a color map.
