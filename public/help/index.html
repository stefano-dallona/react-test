<h1>PLC Testbench UI</h1>
<p>
    The purpose of the user interface for the Testbench PLC is to make it easier to use, reduce the time required to
    consult results and increase the quantity and quality of information obtained from the analysis of results.
</p>
Before the implementation of this user interface, the only available interaction took place directly in a Jupyter
Notebook, where inputs are given directly by modifying the code. Moreover, there was no aid in the interpretation of
results, so the only way was to consult the raw output audio files and images. This type of interaction is suboptimal,
especially in terms of consulting the results, as one is forced to consider one element at a time, precluding the
possibility of increasing the quality of the analysis by considering multiple aspects at once.
<p>
    The user interface can be conceptually divided into three parts:
</p>
<h2>Input selection</h2>
<p>
    This part groups all the interactions that occur before program execution that are aimed at input selection. As
    detailed in the previous discussion, the program inputs are a collection of modules with the associated set of
    settings.
</p>
<p>
    User interaction in this section is intended to simplify and speed up the input process and ends with the start of
    program execution.
</p>
<h2>Progress Monitoring</h2>
<p>
    This part represents the program feedback aimed at informing the user about the status of the execution of the
    various modules of the testbench.
</p>
<p>
    The layout of this interface is strongly related to the choices in the previous section and is mainly focused on the
    loading bars.
</p>
<h2>Results Analysis</h2>
<p>
    Results consultation is the most relevant part of this project in terms of its impact on the user experience of this
    program. At the same time, it is also the most challenging part in terms of design and implementation.
</p>
<p>
    The results consultation groups all the interactions that occur once the program execution is finished and is
    characterized by browsing waveforms, series of lost packets, and listening to the audio files involved.
</p>
<p>
    Since for each input audio file, there are potentially many results to show, it would be ideal to be able to overlay
    as
    many results as possible on the same graph. This is made possible by the fact that all results for the same audio
    file
    share the same time axis.
</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>
    The user interface application is made of a Web application which is composed of two layers: one managing the user
    interface representation and the interaction with the user and the other providing the backend services to be
    consumed
    by the graphical components.
</p>
<p>
    The application therefore can be used both as a standalone application by deploying it on the user machine or in a
    multi-user environment where the application is deployed on a remote server.
</p>
<p>
    The layers exchange information via a RESTFul API which, if needed, can be exploited also by third-party services.
    The
    API is secured by using OAuth 2 protocol.
</p>
<p>
    In the presentation layer, modularity has been achieved through the creation of specialized but highly customizable
    components that can easily be reused across different pages.
</p>
<p>
    In the backend layer, modularity is provided by the extensibility of the RESTFul API where new functions can be
    “plugged
    in” by simply adding new endpoints. This layer is also hiding the details of the interaction with the PLC Testbench
    from
    the presentation layer, providing an abstract and stable view of the library functions.
</p>
<p>
    Persistence is based on a NoSQL database, where the data are stored in JSON format in order to provide higher
    flexibility to accommodate future evolution of the schema. Both on-premise and cloud databases are supported.
</p>
<p>
    The GUI adapts automatically to the PLC Testbench library by using introspection to retrieve the list of the
    algorithms
    used for packet loss, PLC, and output analysis. This way any extension made to the underlying tool does not require
    any
    manual change to the UI code.
