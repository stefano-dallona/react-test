<h1>PLC Testbench</h1>
<p>
    The testbench for these algorithms has the task of measuring the performance of different algorithms to compare them
    with each other. The performance of these algorithms can vary according to the time distribution of lost packets but
    also according to the type of musical audio on which they are applied. This introduces the need to measure the
    performance of each algorithm by varying both the distribution of lost packets and the type of audio considered.
    Finally, there are several techniques for measuring the performance of PLC algorithms, so it is necessary to be able
    to choose which one to use.

<h2>Inputs</h2>
<p>
    This testbed needs several pieces of information before measurements can be made:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b><i>Audio files:</i></b> which audio files to consider.</li>
    <li><b><i>Distributions of lost packets:</i></b> what temporal distributions to use to simulate packet loss.</li>
    <li><b><i>PLC algorithms:</i></b> which PLC algorithms to apply to the signal where packets are missing.</li>
    <li><b><i>Performance evaluation metrics:</i></b> what metrics to use to measure the performance of PLC algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    With this information, the testbench can form all possible combinations and measure the performance of each
    according to the tree structure in Figure:

<p>
    The tree structure of the test bench for evaluating PLC algorithms. All specified lost packet distributions are
    applied to each audio file; in turn, all specified PLC algorithms are applied to each “damaged” audio. Finally, all
    specified performance evaluation metrics are applied to each “reconstructed” audio.
</p>
<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>
    Once all the above combinations have been completed, the testbed produces different types of results. The final
    results are represented by all the performance evaluation metrics calculated for each combination. However,
    intermediate results may also be of interest to the researcher who is studying and developing a PLC algorithm.
    Intermediate results include the realizations extracted from the time distributions that were used and the audio
    files to which a PLC algorithm was applied. Although they are not modified in any way, the original audio files can
    also be considered an interesting output of this testbed, as they represent the ground truth for PLC algorithms.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, these are all the outputs provided by this testbed:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li><b><i>Original audio files:</i></b> the same audio files provided as input.</li>
    <li><b><i>Realizations of lost packet distributions:</i></b> the time series of lost packets used by the testbed.</li>
    <li><b><i>Reconstructed audio files:</i></b> the audio files to which a PLC algorithm was applied.</li>
    <li><b><i>Performance evaluation metrics:</i></b> the metrics calculated for each combination.</li>
</ul>
