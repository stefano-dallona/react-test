<h1>Packet Loss Concealment</h1>
<p>
    PLC algorithms are typically needed in real-time data transmission contexts, and their job is to mask
    (“conceal”) any loss that may occur to one or more packets in a manner that is transparent to the
    application consuming the data stream. Any PLC algorithm needs to satisfy the following requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Its execution time needs to be smaller than the period between the consumption of packets.
    </li>
    <li>
        Its output doesn’t need to match exactly the content of the corresponding packet. However, when put back
        in place of the lost packet, it needs to be perceptually indistinguishable from the original audio
        stream.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are many ways to perform PLC on audio signals. From simpler waveform-based solutions such as
    waveform repetition and PSOLA to more advanced autoregressive models. Recently, Deep Learning based PLC
    has begun to arise in the literature with some noticeable examples both in speech and music.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of the type, they all use the audio data received immediately before the lost packet as the
    input to the algorithm, which will output the number of samples contained in the lost packet.

    In this paper, we present a software tool to study packet loss in audio streams and study, compare, and
    evaluate PLC algorithms for audio.
